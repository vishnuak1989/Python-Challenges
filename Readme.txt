My solutions for some of the simple python coding challanges available online.
I had done these challenges a long time ago in Python 2.x. The programs are re-written them in Python 3.x for reference.
I have solved only some of the question created by https://github.com/zhiwehu
Link to the original challenges:

The solutions are uploaded as .py files with the same name is the question. For example. Solution for Question 6 is Q6.py
Question 6,7,8,18,19,20,21,22
These question are of Level 3 in the original challenges list.
